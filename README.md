2. Unzip the archive to your `wp-content/plugins` folder.
3. Run `composer install` (install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)).
4. Run `yarn && yarn build` (install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)).

## Usage

* When adding an image while editing a page or in Media Library, choose the "Upload via Uploadcare" option.
* Use a built-in image editor when needed.
* If you accidentally upload a file using a standard WordPress option, you can easily transfer them to Uploadcare to use Adaptive Delivery and other features.
