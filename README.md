## Features

* Upload from your device, URL, social network (Facebook, Instagram, VK, Flickr), and cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Photos, OneDrive, Box, Huddle, Evernote).
* Insert images and galleries, embed video & audio files into your posts, and place other files and archives for download.

### Manual installation

1. Download the [latest release][github-releases]. The zip file contains the Wordpress plugin.
2. Unzip the archive to your `wp-content/plugins` folder.
3. Run `composer install` (install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)).
4. Run `yarn && yarn build` (install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)).
5. Activate the plugin in the "Plugins" menu in your WordPress admin account.
6. Go to "Settings" -> "Uploadcare" and follow the instructions.

## Usage

* To add an image, video & audio while editing a post or a page, choose one of the Uploadcare blocks. Also, you can upload any file directly to your Media Library with “Upload with Uploadcare” button — it’ll be hosted and delivered with Uploadcare.
* Use a built-in image editor when needed.
* If you accidentally upload a file using a standard WordPress option, you can easily transfer them to Uploadcare to use Adaptive Delivery and other features.
